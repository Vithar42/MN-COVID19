# MN-COVID-19
This r script was setup for my personal use to look at COVID-19 data in Minnesota (not a lot of comments: added later if I have time). 

1. Please download both files to the same directory

2. Run "COVID-NYTImeData.R", which will grab county data from NYtimes github repo and generate plots and save a png file as "MNcounty_COVID-19.png".

3. Outputs a pdf file named "COVID_markdown.pdf".

Note: 
  
  - Data source: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data
  
  - Library needed for this R markdown: tidyverse, ggpubr
