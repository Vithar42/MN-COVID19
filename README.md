# MN-COVID
This r markdown file was setup for my personal use (not a lot of commenting).

Please download all files to the same directory and run "COVID.Rproj"

Open "COVID_markdown.Rmd" and knit the pdf. This file will call "COVID.R", which will preprocess "MNCovidData.csv" and generate plots.

Note: The csv data (current version: 2020-04-08) may not be updated regularly, but you can find the most recent data in the following link .
